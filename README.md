# Quantium_virtual_internship_DataAnalytics

## Introduction
This repository documents my participation in a virtual internship program facilitated by **Quantium**, a prominent player in the data science industry. The internship, hosted on **Forage**, provided a unique opportunity to engage in a project involving the analysis of a client's transaction dataset to extract insights and offer commercial recommendations. I conducted these analyses using Python, gaining practical experience in data visualization and analysis within a real-world context.

## Files in the Repository

- [QVI_Task1_Python_Script.ipynb](QVI_Task1_Python_Script.ipynb)

  Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics. Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviors to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations. This file comprises code for that.

- [QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv](QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv) & [QVI_transaction_data.csv](QVI_transaction_data.csv)

  These are the resource files for task one.

- [QVI_Task2_Python_Script.ipynb](QVI_Task2_Python_Script.ipynb)

  Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing. Examine the performance in trial vs control stores to provide a recommendation for each location based on our insights. In this task, trial stores are those where specific changes or interventions have been implemented, while control stores are used as a reference group for comparison. The analysis aims to evaluate the impact of these changes on store performance. This file comprises code for that.
